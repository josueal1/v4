In order to validate our problem statement and competitive-analysis, we created a survey to see how the intended users
currently and narrow down our scope to specific items. So, we created a survey to see how the intended users currently
feel about ‘green’ products. From the results, we found that users:

<ul>
  <li>would choose a green option if it was not
      more expensive</li>
  <li>purchase personal care, cleaning products, and clothing</li>
  <li>do mind the ethical labor practices</li>
</ul>
