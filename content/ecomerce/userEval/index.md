We then took our interactive prototype and conducted usability tests with college students as participants.
Each participant was asked to complete 3 tasks using the prototype and to give feedback on the current state of the UI.

Our participants liked that the layout of the content was easy to navigate and that the design centered around the userâ€™s preferences

They also suggested making the text larger, choosing a more minimal color theme, and adding a shopping cart feature
